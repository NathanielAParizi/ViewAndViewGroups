1. The Singleton pattern will restrict the instantiation of a class to just one single object. It is useful when we only need one
instance of our class. A common use of the Singleton pattern is with handling a single database connection which may see

Factory pattern creates an object without needing to require specifications from a separate class which refers
to objects using a common interface.
